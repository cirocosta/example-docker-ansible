# This is a little role that I always execute at first
# when I'm provision machines from ground up. Because
# some roles might require knowledge about the machine
# (gathered via `gather_facts`) and obtaining such knowledge
# require python, with this role we can bootstrap the 
# python installation with plain ansible SSH communication.
#       -       by not gathering facts and execution 
#               almost manually the `apt install` script
#               we can install it.
# Check the role at https://github.com/cirocosta/example-docker-ansible
